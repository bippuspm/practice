Question: How do I save the data file they want me to save on my virtual machine instead of on my computer? Do I have to save it to my computer first then upload it through the 'files' tab on the right?

#can upload through the files panel but not for very large files like MiSeq run
#can copy link and in the console:
download.file("copy link", "/home/.../name of file")

#if downloading MiSeq data not on a web server, do it through the terminal doing SFTP
